# The next Busquets
Using KMeans clustering to find which players are most similar to Sergio Busquets.

This is my first attempt at using k-means clustering to try and find players that are similar to Sergio Busquets given n different metrics. It will be split between 2 main files:

- `mf_top5.R` Thanks to the [worldfootballR](https://jaseziv.github.io/worldfootballR/index.html) package created by @jaseziv I'll be scraping data for all the players in the Top 5 Leagues in Europe from [FBRef](https://www.fbref.com). 
- `clustering_busi` And then in a Python Notebook I'll be trying my hand at some beginner Machine Learning with KMeans to find clusters of players.
