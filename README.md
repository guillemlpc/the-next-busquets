# The next Busquets
Using KMeans clustering to find which players are most similar to Sergio Busquets.

This is my first attempt at using k-means clustering to try and find players that are similar to Sergio Busquets given n different metrics. It will be split between 2 main files:

- `mf_top5.R` In this file I load the data for all the players in the Top 5 Leagues in Europe from [FBRef](https://www.fbref.com) for given statistics and I put it all together in a CSV file which I export for further exploration. 
- `cluster_busi.py` And then in Python I'll be trying my hand at some beginner Machine Learning with KMeans to find clusters of players.
